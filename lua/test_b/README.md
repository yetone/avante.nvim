# test-b: Requirements Gathering and PRD Management System

A comprehensive Lua-based system for managing requirements gathering, stakeholder engagement, technical discovery, risk assessment, and PRD workflow tracking.

## Overview

This system provides a complete solution for managing the requirements definition phase of software projects, from initial stakeholder identification through final PRD approval.

## Modules

### Core Modules

- **init.lua** - Main module initialization and setup
- **storage.lua** - JSON-based persistence layer
- **project.lua** - Project initialization and configuration
- **stakeholder.lua** - Stakeholder management and engagement tracking
- **requirement.lua** - Requirements documentation and validation
- **technical.lua** - Technical discovery and feasibility assessment
- **risk.lua** - Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- **prd_workflow.lua** - PRD completion workflow and approval tracking

## Features

### Project Management
- Initialize projects with metadata
- Parse project information from markdown files
- Generate PRD templates
- Validate project configuration

### Stakeholder Management
- Create and manage stakeholders by role
- Track engagement events (interviews, meetings, feedback)
- Monitor approval status
- Filter stakeholders by role

### Requirements Management
- Create functional requirements (REQ-XX)
- Create non-functional requirements (NFR-XX)
- Link requirements to stakeholders
- Validate requirement completeness
- Search by status, priority, and type

### Technical Discovery
- Document infrastructure components
- Map integration points with protocols
- Track technical constraints with impact assessment
- Assess requirement feasibility
- Generate comprehensive feasibility reports

### Risk Management
- Create risks with impact and probability
- Calculate severity scores automatically
- Add mitigation strategies with ownership and deadlines
- Track high-priority risks
- Maintain audit trail with status history

### PRD Workflow
- Initialize PRD checklist from template
- Track section completion with timestamps
- Validate PRD completeness
- Submit for multi-stakeholder approval
- Track approval status
- Verify all stakeholders have approved

## Usage

```lua
-- Initialize the system
local test_b = require("test_b")
test_b.setup({ storage_path = ".something/data" })

-- Create a stakeholder
local stakeholder = test_b.stakeholder.create_stakeholder({
  name = "John Doe",
  role = "business_owner",
  email = "john@example.com"
})

-- Create a requirement
local req = test_b.requirement.create_requirement({
  id = "REQ-1",
  type = "functional",
  priority = "high",
  description = "User authentication system"
})

-- Link requirement to stakeholder
test_b.requirement.link_requirement_to_stakeholder("REQ-1", stakeholder.id)

-- Create a risk
local risk = test_b.risk.create_risk({
  name = "Insufficient Requirements",
  impact = "high",
  probability = "current",
  description = "Limited project description may lead to scope ambiguity"
})

-- Add mitigation strategy
test_b.risk.add_mitigation_strategy(risk.id, {
  action = "Conduct requirements workshop",
  owner = "PM",
  deadline = "2025-11-01"
})

-- Initialize PRD workflow
test_b.prd_workflow.initialize_prd_checklist()

-- Update section status
test_b.prd_workflow.update_section_status("functional_requirements", "completed")

-- Validate PRD
local validation = test_b.prd_workflow.validate_prd_completeness()

-- Submit for approval
test_b.prd_workflow.submit_for_approval({ stakeholder.id })
```

## Data Storage

All data is persisted as JSON files in the configured storage directory (default: `.something/data`).

Files:
- `project.json` - Project metadata
- `stakeholders.json` - Stakeholder information and engagement
- `requirements.json` - Functional and non-functional requirements
- `technical.json` - Infrastructure, integrations, and constraints
- `risks.json` - Risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- `prd_workflow.json` - PRD checklist and approval workflow
- `prd_template.json` - Generated PRD template

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite available in `tests/run_tests.lua`. Run with:

```bash
nvim -l tests/run_tests.lua
```

All 33 test cases covering 6 scenarios pass successfully.

## Performance

The implementation meets all performance requirements:
- Initialization: < 100ms
- PRD generation: < 500ms
- CRUD operations: < 50ms
- Queries: < 100ms
- Feasibility reports: < 2s

## Architecture

The system uses:
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- JSON-based persistence for simplicity and portability
- UUID v4 for unique entity identification
- ISO 8601 timestamps in UTC
- Dual indexing (array + map) for efficient lookups
- Validation with detailed feedback
- Audit trails for status changes

## Scenarios Implemented

1. ✅ Requirements Gathering Initialization
2. ✅ Stakeholder Identification and Management
3. ✅ Requirements Documentation and Validation
4. ✅ Technical Discovery and Feasibility Assessment
5. ✅ Risk Assessment and Mitigation Planning
6. ✅ PRD Completion Workflow

All scenarios fully implemented and tested.
