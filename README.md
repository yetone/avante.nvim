# avante.nvim (Alpha)

**avante.nvim** is a Neovim plugin designed to emulate the behavior of the [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) AI IDE, providing users with AI-driven code suggestions and the ability to apply these recommendations directly to their source files with minimal effort.

> [!NOTE]
>
> ⚠️ This plugin is still in a very early stage of development, so please be aware that the current code is very messy and unstable, and problems are likely to occur.
>
> 🥰 This project is undergoing rapid iterations, and many exciting features will be added successively. Stay tuned!

## Features

- **AI-Powered Code Assistance**: Interact with AI to ask questions about your current code file and receive intelligent suggestions for improvement or modification.
- **One-Click Application**: Quickly apply the AI's suggested changes to your source code with a single command, streamlining the editing process and saving time.

## Installation

Install `avante.nvim` using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "yetone/avante.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  build = "make",
  opts = {
    -- add any opts here
  },
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
    "stevearc/dressing.nvim",
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    {
      "grapp-dev/nui-components.nvim",
      dependencies = {
        "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim"
      }
    },
    --- The below is optional, make sure to setup it properly if you have lazy=true
    {
      'MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim',
      opts = {
        file_types = { "markdown", "Avante" },
      },
      ft = { "markdown", "Avante" },
    },
  },
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `avante.nvim` is currently only compatible with Neovim 0.10.0 or later. Please ensure that your Neovim version meets these requirements before proceeding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If your neovim doesn't use LuaJIT, then change `build` to `make lua51`. By default running make will install luajit.
> For ARM-based setup, make sure to also install cargo as we will have to build the tiktoken_core from source.

> [!NOTE]
>
> `render-markdown.nvim` is an optional dependency that is used to render the markdown content of the chat history. Make sure to also include `Avante` as a filetype
> to its setup:
>
> ```lua
> {
>   "MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim",
>   opts = {
>     file_types = { "markdown", "Avante" },
>   },
>   ft = { "markdown", "Avante" },
> }
> ```

Default setup configuration:

_See [config.lua#L9](./lua/avante/config.lua) for the full config_

```lua
{
  ---@alias Provider "openai" | "claude" | "azure" | "deepseek" | "groq"
  provider = "claude", -- "claude" or "openai" or "azure" or "deepseek" or "groq"
  openai = {
    endpoint = "https://api.openai.com",
    model = "gpt-4o",
    temperature = 0,
    max_tokens = 4096,
  },
  azure = {
    endpoint = "", -- example: "https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com"
    deployment = "", -- Azure deployment name (e.g., "gpt-4o", "my-gpt-4o-deployment")
    api_version = "2024-06-01",
    temperature = 0,
    max_tokens = 4096,
  },
  claude = {
    endpoint = "https://api.anthropic.com",
    model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
    temperature = 0,
    max_tokens = 4096,
  },
  highlights = {
    ---@type AvanteConflictHighlights
    diff = {
      current = "DiffText",
      incoming = "DiffAdd",
    },
  },
  mappings = {
    ask = "<leader>aa",
    edit = "<leader>ae",
    refresh = "<leader>ar",
    --- @class AvanteConflictMappings
    diff = {
      ours = "co",
      theirs = "ct",
      none = "c0",
      both = "cb",
      next = "]x",
      prev = "[x",
    },
    jump = {
      next = "]]",
      prev = "[[",
    },
  },
  windows = {
    wrap_line = true,
    width = 30, -- default % based on available width
  },
  --- @class AvanteConflictUserConfig
  diff = {
    debug = false,
    autojump = true,
    ---@type string | fun(): any
    list_opener = "copen",
  },
}
```

## Usage

Given its early stage, `avante.nvim` currently supports the following basic functionalities:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For most consistency between neovim session, it is recommended to set the environment variables in your shell file.
> By default, `Avante` will prompt you at startup to input the API key for the provider you have selected.
>
> For Claude:
>
> ```sh
> export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
> ```
>
> For OpenAI:
>
> ```sh
> export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
> ```
>
> For Azure OpenAI:
>
> ```sh
> export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
> ```
>
> For DeepSeek
>
> ```sh
> export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=you-api-key
> ```
>
> For Groq
>
> ```sh
> export GROQ_API_KEY=you-api-key
> ```

1. Open a code file in Neovim.
2. Use the `:AvanteAsk` command to query the AI about the code.
3. Review the AI's suggestions.
4. Apply the recommended changes directly to your code with a simple command or key binding.

**Note**: The plugin is still under active development, and both its functionality and interface are subject to significant changes. Expect some rough edges and instability as the project evolves.

## Contributing

Contributions to avante.nvim are welcome! If you're interested in helping out, please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues. Before contributing, ensure that your code has been thoroughly tested.

## Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Install [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) for Lua code formatting.
2. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) for managing and maintaining pre-commit hooks.
3. After cloning the repository, run the following command to set up pre-commit hooks:

```sh
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

For setting up lua_ls you can use the following for `nvim-lspconfig`:

```lua
lua_ls = {
  settings = {
    Lua = {
      runtime = {
        version = "LuaJIT",
        special = { reload = "require" },
      },
      workspace = {
        library = {
          vim.fn.expand "$VIMRUNTIME/lua",
          vim.fn.expand "$VIMRUNTIME/lua/vim/lsp",
          vim.fn.stdpath "data" .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim/lua/lazy",
          vim.fn.expand "$HOME/path/to/parent" -- parent/avante.nvim
          "${3rd}/luv/library",
        },
      },
    },
  },
},
```

Then you can set `dev = true` in your `lazy` config for development.
