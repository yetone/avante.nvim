# avante.nvim

**avante.nvim** is a Neovim plugin designed to emulate the behaviour of the [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) AI IDE. It provides users with AI-driven code suggestions and the ability to apply these recommendations directly to their source files with minimal effort.

> [!NOTE]
>
> ðŸ¥° This project is undergoing rapid iterations, and many exciting features will be added successively. Stay tuned!

## Features

- **AI-Powered Code Assistance**: Interact with AI to ask questions about your current code file and receive intelligent suggestions for improvement or modification.
- **One-Click Application**: Quickly apply the AI's suggested changes to your source code with a single command, streamlining the editing process and saving time.

## Installation

Install `avante.nvim` using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "yetone/avante.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  build = "make",
  opts = {
    -- add any opts here
  },
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons", -- or echasnovski/mini.icons
    "stevearc/dressing.nvim",
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
    --- The below is optional, make sure to setup it properly if you have lazy=true
    {
      'MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim',
      opts = {
        file_types = { "markdown", "Avante" },
      },
      ft = { "markdown", "Avante" },
    },
  },
}
```

For Windows users, change the build command to the following:

```lua
{
  "yetone/avante.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  build = "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Build-LuaTiktoken.ps1",
  -- rest of the config
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `avante.nvim` is currently only compatible with Neovim 0.10.0 or later. Please ensure that your Neovim version meets these requirements before proceeding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If your neovim doesn't use LuaJIT, then change `build` to `make lua51`. By default running make will install luajit.
> For ARM-based setup, make sure to also install cargo as we will have to build the tiktoken_core from source.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Recommended **Neovim** options:
>
> ```lua
> -- views can only be fully collapsed with the global statusline
> vim.opt.laststatus = 3
> -- Default splitting will cause your main splits to jump when opening an edgebar.
> -- To prevent this, set `splitkeep` to either `screen` or `topline`.
> vim.opt.splitkeep = "screen"
> ```

> [!NOTE]
>
> `render-markdown.nvim` is an optional dependency that is used to render the markdown content of the chat history. Make sure to also include `Avante` as a filetype
> to its setup:
>
> ```lua
> {
>   "MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim",
>   opts = {
>     file_types = { "markdown", "Avante" },
>   },
>   ft = { "markdown", "Avante" },
> }
> ```

Default setup configuration:

_See [config.lua#L9](./lua/avante/config.lua) for the full config_

```lua
{
  ---@alias Provider "openai" | "claude" | "azure"  | "copilot" | [string]
  provider = "claude",
  claude = {
    endpoint = "https://api.anthropic.com",
    model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
    temperature = 0,
    max_tokens = 4096,
  },
  mappings = {
    ask = "<leader>aa",
    edit = "<leader>ae",
    refresh = "<leader>ar",
    --- @class AvanteConflictMappings
    diff = {
      ours = "co",
      theirs = "ct",
      none = "c0",
      both = "cb",
      next = "]x",
      prev = "[x",
    },
    jump = {
      next = "]]",
      prev = "[[",
    },
  },
  hints = { enabled = true },
  windows = {
    wrap = true, -- similar to vim.o.wrap
    width = 30, -- default % based on available width
    sidebar_header = {
      align = "center", -- left, center, right for title
      rounded = true,
    },
  },
  highlights = {
    ---@type AvanteConflictHighlights
    diff = {
      current = "DiffText",
      incoming = "DiffAdd",
    },
  },
  --- @class AvanteConflictUserConfig
  diff = {
    debug = false,
    autojump = true,
    ---@type string | fun(): any
    list_opener = "copen",
  },
}
```

## Usage

Given its early stage, `avante.nvim` currently supports the following basic functionalities:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Avante will only support OpenAI (and its variants including copilot and azure), and Claude out-of-the-box due to its high code quality generation.
> For all OpenAI-compatible providers, see [wiki](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim/wiki) for more details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For most consistency between neovim session, it is recommended to set the environment variables in your shell file.
> By default, `Avante` will prompt you at startup to input the API key for the provider you have selected.
>
> For Claude:
>
> ```sh
> export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
> ```
>
> For OpenAI:
>
> ```sh
> export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
> ```
>
> For Azure OpenAI:
>
> ```sh
> export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
> ```

1. Open a code file in Neovim.
2. Use the `:AvanteAsk` command to query the AI about the code.
3. Review the AI's suggestions.
4. Apply the recommended changes directly to your code with a simple command or key binding.

**Note**: The plugin is still under active development, and both its functionality and interface are subject to significant changes. Expect some rough edges and instability as the project evolves.
