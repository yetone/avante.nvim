## What is avante.nvim?

## Why avante.nvim?

In the era of Coding Agent CLIs, many argue that editors are no longer needed. However, **avante.nvim** proves that Terminal-based Editors have already solved and standardized the biggest problem with Terminal-based applications ‚Äî awkward TUI interactions!

No matter how much these Coding Agent CLIs optimize their UI/UX, they will always be a subset of Terminal-based Editors (Vim, Emacs). They cannot achieve Vim's elegant action + text objects abstraction, nor can they leverage thousands of mature Vim/Neovim plugins to optimize TUI UI/UX.

With **avante.nvim**, you get:

- The power of AI-driven coding assistance
- Your familiar Vim/Neovim muscle memory
- Rich ecosystem of Neovim plugins
- Seamless code viewing and modification without context switching
- All the capabilities of claude code / gemini-cli / codex through ACP support

## Quick Start

Install with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):
